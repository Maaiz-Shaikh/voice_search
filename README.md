# Voice-Based Video Content Search Web App

Welcome to the Voice-Based Video Content Search web app! This project allows users to effortlessly search for specific words within YouTube videos, utilizing voice recognition or text input. The app provides timestamps of word occurrences, enabling users to navigate directly to relevant segments of the video.

## Features

- **Voice and Text Search**: Seamlessly search for keywords within videos by either typing the word or using voice commands through the microphone.

- **Timestamp Retrieval**: Retrieve accurate timestamps for each occurrence of the searched word within the video content.

- **Efficient Navigation**: Click on timestamps to instantly navigate to the exact moment in the video where the word appears.

- **YouTube Video Integration**: Input a YouTube video URL to load and analyze videos directly within the app.

- **Light and Dark Modes**: Choose between light and dark themes for a personalized and comfortable viewing experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Developed using the Flutter framework, the frontend offers a sleek and intuitive user interface for a seamless browsing experience.

- **Backend**: Powered by Flask, a Python-based backend processes user requests through REST APIs, efficiently managing video content and search queries.

- **Voice Recognition**: Utilizes advanced voice recognition technology to enable users to search using their voice.

- **Subtitle (SRT) Conversion**: The backend converts video content into SubRip (SRT) format, optimizing search efficiency.
